============
The iTunes Analyzer is a small project to provide analytics about your iTunes library. The demo data is of my library but by uploading your **iTunes Music Library.xml** file you can analyze your own library out of the box.

The iTunes Analyzer is also an experimental project of mine to learn more about [D3.js](http://d3js.org/) which is heavily used throughout the project. Below is a list of the analytics available.

## Top Songs ##
The most basic metric of a library is its top songs. The top songs are listed showing song name, artist, play count, and genre. The top genres are also shown as filters, allowing you to find the top songs within a genre or set of genres. Transitions and layouts are created by utilizing [D3.js](http://d3js.org/).
